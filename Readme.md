## üëå Features

# **Libraries**

### SmartBotKit.Core
This is the main assembly required for all my plugins. So you need to install this.Ôªø 

This is a public API that extends the official SB API (nothing special, just a little bit of reusable code used Ôªøfor my plugins).

The library exposes members to interoperate with SmartBot process and Win32 API, which are required by my plugins

Installation:

# **Plugins**

### Advanced Auto-Concede
A plugin to build auto-concede rules.

Settings:

![](Images/Advanced%20Auto-Concede%20-%20Settings.png)

### App Launcher
A plugin that automate external files and programs execution at SmartBot's startup.

You can run any kind of executable file type, which is not limited to .exe files.

You can even run Blizzard's Battle.net client if you like. 

Settings:

![](Images/App%20Launcher%20-%20Settings.png)

### Auto-Injector
A plugin that automate SmartBot injection to Hearthstone process.

That is, everytime you run Hearthstone while SmartBot is running and this plugin is enabled,
the plugin will auto-inject the Hearthstone process, and auto-start the bot if you specified to do that in the plugin settings.

Settings:

It also includes a simple script made in Power-Shell to parse the CSV table.

### Garbage Cleaner
A plugin that cleans temporary files generated by SmartBot and its plugins.

Settings:

![](Images/Garbage%20Cleaner%20-%20Settings.png)

### Hearthstone Resizer
A plugin that maintains a fixed size and location for Hearthstone window.

You can configure the plugin to resize the window every timer tick, or each 5 ticks, for example.

The plugin is aware of when Hearthstone window is maximized, and when it is at fullscreen mode.

It will not try to move/resize its window in those circunstances.
(however, I didn't tested the fullscreen mode detection on multi-monitor configurations)

Note that I didn't provided any 16:9 resolution just because Hearthstone process does not like those resolutions;

when attempting to resize Hearthstone window to a 16:9 size, its process will automatically change to a different size.

Settings:

![](Images/Hearthstone%20Resizer%20-%20Settings.png)

### Legend Rank Handler
A plugin that handles what to do when the bot reachs legend rank.

Legend Rank Handler lets you decide what to do when SmartBot reachs legend rank. You can use this plugin to stop Smartbot, hibernate/suspend/shutdown the computer, play a sound file and send a notification to a specified mail address.

Settings:

![](Images/Legend%20Rank%20Handler%20-%20Settings.png)

Default mail message:

![](Images/Legend%20Rank%20Handler%20-%20Default%20Mail%20Message.png)

### Matchmaker
A plugin that helps you to find your best opponent match.

Matchmaker lets you automatically start and concede games until it finds one of the allowed opponent classes to play a match with. Once a match is found, the bot will stop.

** This plugin has a human supervised purpose and for that reason it should be used without any kind of questing or concede plugins enabled.

Settings:

![](Images/Matchmaker%20-%20Settings.png)

### Offline Server handler
A plugin that handles the bot behavior when the server gets down. 

Note that it Ôªødoes not Ôªøhandle Ôªølag, Ôªølocal network inactivityÔªøÔªø neither Ôªøauthentication connection problems.

I totally suggest to use this plugin to avoid losing rank stars o farmed gold botting in ArenaAuto mode when the server is down.

Settings:

![](Images/Offline%20Server%20handler%20-%20Settings.png)

### Panic Button
A plugin that stops or terminates SmartBot process when a specified hotkey combination is pressed.

You can stablish a hotkey combination of 1, 2 or 3 simultaneous keys.

You can literally specify any single keyboard key or override any special hotkey (like CTRL+C) from the available range of keys that I provided.

The plugin registers a new, temporary system-wide hotkey.

During the lifetime of SmartBot process and while the plugin is activated, you can press the hotkey combination anywhere on the screen.

When the plugin is deactivated or SmartBot process is terminated, the system-wide hotkey is unregistered.

Don't be worried about, Windows operating system will ensure itself that the temporary hotkey Ôªøgets unregistered,
so the functionality of any modified key (or overriden operating system hotkey) will return to normal. 

Settings:

![](Images/Panic%20Button%20-%20Settings.png)

### UI Enhancer
A plugin that adds visual enhancements for the SmartBot user-interface.

Features:
- Creates a system-tray icon with menu commands to handle SmartBot and Hearthstone visibility.
- Prints statistical information on the SmartBot's taskbar icon and also displays a progress bar when playing Arena mode.
- Remembers the last SmartBot's window size and position and restore it at the next program startup.
